* Rewrite prototype for real, including tests.

### Trace code

* Rewrite (at least) hot paths in a C extension.
* Get sender mod+name of call and use that to link to callers instead of path. This can only be done in C.

* Collecting call return values is not working right yet.
* Collecting call arguments works fine, but isn't needed yet and needs memory usage optimization.

### Reporting

* Show call arguments and returns values in report.
* Add way to filter what's included, by path, class, etc.

### HTML

* Fix div.line getting taller when calls are being shown (on hover).
* Make call history work relative, i.e. without full expanded hardcoded paths.
